# Differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods for Real-Time Modeling of Deformable Linear Objects
This paper addresses the task of modeling Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs), such as ropes and cables, during dynamic motion over long time horizons.This task presents significant challenges due to the complex dynamics of DLOs.To address these challenges, this paper proposes differentiable Discrete Elastic Rods For deformable linear Objects with Real-time Modeling (DEFORM), 
a novel framework that combines a differentiable physics-based model with a learning framework to model DLOs accurately and in real-time.
